In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. BY USING THESE FEATURES, YOU CONSENT TO THE TRANSMISSION OF THIS INFORMATION. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.

        Computer Information.  The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the device where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.
            Windows Update Feature.  You may connect new hardware to the device where you installed the software. Your device may not have the drivers needed to communicate with that hardware. If so, the update feature of the software can obtain the correct driver from Microsoft and install it on your device. You can switch off this update feature.

            Web Content Features.  Features in the software can retrieve related content from Microsoft and provide it to you. To provide the content, these features send to Microsoft the type of operating system, name and version of the software you are using, type of browser and language code of the device where you installed the software. Examples of these features are clip art, templates, online training, online assistance and Appshelp. You may choose not to use these web content features.

        Misuse of Internet-based Services.  You may not use these services in any way that could harm them or impair anyone else's use of them. You may not use the services to try to gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means.

    TRIAL EDITION SOFTWARE TERMS.  The following terms apply to the Trial Edition software even if there are terms to the contrary in other parts of this agreement:

        TIME-SENSITIVE SOFTWARE.  If the version of the software is a Trial Edition, the software will stop running ninety days after you install it. You will receive notice before it stops running. You may not be able to access data used with the software when it stops running.

        DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  THE TRIAL EDITION SOFTWARE IS LICENSED "AS-IS." YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES OR CONDITIONS. YOU MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER RIGHTS UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS WHICH THIS AGREEMENT CANNOT CHANGE. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER YOUR LOCAL LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

        LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES.  FOR THE TRIAL EDITION SOFTWARE, YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO U.S. $5.00. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

        This limitation applies to

            anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and

            claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

        It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.

    PRODUCT KEYS.  The software requires a key to install or access it. You are responsible for the use of keys assigned to you. You should not share the keys with third parties.

    SQL SERVER BENCHMARK TESTING.  You must obtain Microsoft's prior written approval to disclose to a third party the results of any benchmark test of the SQL Server software that accompanies this software.

    .NET FRAMEWORK SOFTWARE.  The software contains Microsoft .NET Framework software. This software is part of Windows. The license terms for Windows apply to your use of the .NET Framework software.

    MICROSOFT .NET FRAMEWORK BENCHMARK TESTING.  The software includes the .NET Framework component of the Windows operating systems (".NET Component"). You may conduct internal benchmark testing of the .NET Component. You may disclose the results of any benchmark test of the .NET Component, provided that you comply with the following terms:
        you must disclose all the information necessary for replication of the tests, including complete and accurate details of your benchmark testing methodology, the test scripts/cases, tuning parameters applied, hardware and software platforms tested, the name and version number of any third party testing tool used to conduct the testing, and complete source code for the benchmark suite/harness that is developed by or for you and used to test both the .NET Component and the competing implementation(s);
        you must disclose the date (s) that you conducted the benchmark tests, along with specific version information for all Microsoft software products tested, including the .NET Component;
        your benchmark testing was performed using all performance tuning and best practice guidance set forth in the product documentation and/or on Microsoft's support web sites, and uses the latest updates, patches and fixes available for the .NET Component and the relevant Microsoft operating system;
        it shall be sufficient if you make the disclosures provided for above at a publicly available location such as a website, so long as every public disclosure of the results of your benchmark test expressly identifies the public site containing all required disclosures; and
        nothing in this provision shall be deemed to waive any other right that you may have to conduct benchmark testing.
    The foregoing obligations shall not apply to your disclosure of the results of any customized benchmark test of the .NET Component, whereby such disclosure is made under confidentiality in conjunction with a bid request by a prospective customer, such customer's application(s) are specifically tested and the results are only disclosed to such specific customer. Notwithstanding any other agreement you may have with Microsoft, if you disclose such benchmark test results, Microsoft shall have the right to disclose the results of benchmark tests it conducts of your products that compete with the .NET Component, provided it complies with the same conditions above.

    SCOPE OF LICENSE.  The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the software. Microsoft reserves all other rights.

        Program Application and Driver Limitations.  You may not use or include any of the Windows Mobile components located in the "\Program Files\Windows Mobile 5.0 SDK R2\" directory, nor any components thereof, in the development of any program application, device or system in which a malfunction would result in a foreseeable risk of personal injury, death or severe physical or environmental damage.

    BACKUP COPY.  You may make one backup copy of the software. You may use it only to reinstall the software.

    DOCUMENTATION.  Any person that has valid access to your computer or internal network may copy and use the documentation for your internal, reference purposes.

    ACADEMIC EDITION SOFTWARE.  You must be a "Qualified Educational User" to use software marked as "Academic Edition" or "AE." If you do not know whether you are a Qualified Educational User, visit www.microsoft.com/education or contact the Microsoft affiliate serving your country.

    UPGRADE.  If this software is marked as an upgrade version, you may use it only if you have a license to use the software eligible for upgrade. If you upgrade, this software takes the place of the earlier version, and this agreement takes the place of the agreement for that earlier version. You may use the earlier version only as permitted in the Downgrade clause below.

    DOWNGRADE.  You may install and use this version and an earlier version of the software at the same time. This agreement applies to your use of the earlier version. If the earlier version includes different components, any terms for those components in the agreement that comes with the earlier version apply to your use of them. Microsoft is not obligated to supply earlier versions to you.

    TRANSFER TO A THIRD PARTY.  The first user of the software may transfer it, and this agreement, directly to a third party. Before the transfer, that party must agree that this agreement applies to the transfer and use of the software. The first user must uninstall the software before transferring it separately from the device. The first user may not retain any copies.

    EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.  The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations. You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software. These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use. For additional information, see www.microsoft.com/exporting.

    SUPPORT SERVICES.  Microsoft provides support services for the software as described at www.support.microsoft.com/common/international.aspx.

    ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This agreement (including the warranty below), and the terms for supplements, updates, Internet-based services and support services that you use, are the entire agreement for the software and support services.

    APPLICABLE LAW.

        United States.  If you acquired the software in the United States, Washington state law governs the interpretation of this agreement and applies to claims for breach of it, regardless of conflict of laws principles. The laws of the state where you live govern all other claims, including claims under state consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort.

        Outside the United States.  If you acquired the software in any other country, the laws of that country apply.

    LEGAL EFFECT.  This agreement describes certain legal rights. You may have other rights under the laws of your state or country. You may also have rights with respect to the party from whom you acquired the software. This agreement does not change your rights under the laws of your state or country if the laws of your state or country do not permit it to do so.

    LIMITATION ON AND EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES.  YOU CAN RECOVER FROM MICROSOFT AND ITS SUPPLIERS ONLY DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE AMOUNT YOU PAID FOR THE SOFTWARE. YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

    This limitation applies to

        anything related to the software, services, content (including code) on third party Internet sites, or third party programs; and

        claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.

    It also applies even if

        repair, replacement or a refund for the software does not fully compensate you for any losses; or

        Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.

    Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. They also may not apply to you because your country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
